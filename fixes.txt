==Configuration switching with touchscreen firmware v2_20171024==
The original 20170816 firmware does not contain the config.prusa file.
This file should be copied to the 20170816 firmware to make switching between configurations work with the latest touchscreen firmware.

==Z axis endstop not working==
config.lasercartisian: 
changed
> gamma_max_endstop                            1.29^
to
> gamma_max_endstop                            1.29^!

==temperature control configuration==
Makes no sense to be activated, so set
> temperature_control.hotend.enable = false

==network==
Was not enabled in cartesian mode so set
> network.enable = true
